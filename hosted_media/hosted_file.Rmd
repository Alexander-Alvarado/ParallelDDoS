# What is a DDOS?

![](https://ruggedtooling.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Botnet_Attack.png)

> A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. Such an attack is often the result of multiple compromised systems (for example, a botnet) flooding the targeted system with traffic.

## Wait this sounds bad? What are you guys up to!?

We aim to creat an efficient and distributed DDOS that will allow for companies and clients to test how secure their systems are in the case of a **real** DDOS attack.

## Possible use case clients include:

- AWS
- Cloudfare
- Google
- Oracle
- IBM
- _The Chinese Government_
- Microsoft
- DigitalOcean
- and many more!


# Solution Design

## **Method**: HTTP Flood

Benefits:

- No malformed packets
- No spoofing
- No reflection
- Less bandwidth than alternatives
- Harder to detect and block

Attack Type: POST
Targets OSI layer #7

### Weaknesses

- BOT Test
- Web Application Firewalls
- Tricky to program

# So what does this all look like?
