# ParallelDDoS
Code for Intro to Parallel and Distributed Computing Team 8 DDoS project. Current implementation is only serial, but plans to make the program run in parallel.

Due to library restrictions in the ember compute cluster the program has gone from a python to a C program.

The project as it is now works only in serial.

Parallel implementation is the next goal.
